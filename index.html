                Rich: I knew Amy Moore. I knew Amy Sue McGillicuddy. (Laughter) Amy Sue McGillicuddy was my babysitter in the 4th grade. She was my first crush and worthy of such an honor because she was cute.
                <br /><br />
                Jim: Yeah.
                <br /><br />
                Rich: And she was so sweet. And so yeah, Joanna and Amy Sue McGillicuddy and Megamouth and all these folks that you got to nickname.

            <p>Rich: What's the other one? I think it's somewhere else in the book, but it's Spitting Wooden Nickels, that thing. What's that? Can you say it from the beginning?
                <br /><br />
                Jim: Yeah, that's what they say, and almost everybody that calls me up says, "What are you doing?" I say, "Standing my head and wiggling my ears, Spitting Wooden Nickels, drinking water out of dry branches," and I - back sometime in the '60s - I had heard all these things, and so I put together a group that I liked, you know, and there's very - you know, maybe two or three people that have asked me, "What are you doing?" and I catch myself and give them a straight answer, like when the superintendent would call -
                <br /><br />
                Rich: Caldwell or Moses?
                <br /><br />
                Jim: Yeah, Caldwell or Moses, somebody like that called me, I would give them the right answer, but the other side would spit out like that, and it's so funny because you say, "What you're doing?" and so many times they say, "Oh, I got the wrong number." (Laughter)
                <br /><br />
                Rich: Click. (Laughter)
                <br /><br />
                Jim: And you have to catch them because you know who's calling, you know.
                <br /><br />
                Rich: Okay, so that's "This is me" as a...
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Is that from somebody that influenced you or is that just something you said?

                <br /><br />

                Jim: Who knows?" (Laughter) "That's a couple of those. I start singing one song, then switch to the other, you know? And...
                <br /><br />
                Rich: Oh, that's the one. Okay, so I put that on a Methodist hymnal in the 1800s. And basically, I asked Shannon, Joanna, and Matthew to tell me the lyrics to the song. And they all told me very, very wildly different lyrics.
                <br /><br />
                Jim: Oh, yeah.
                <br /><br />
                Rich: So I put it down as three stanzas to the same hymn on a Methodist hymnal.
                <br /><br />
                Jim: Yeah.
                <br /><br />
                Rich: And I had a lot of fun with those. So can you sing the song?
                <br /><br />
                Jim: Probably not. You got pretty close here. The hey-oh, hey-oh, tell you what I say. And that's a Ray Charles thing there.
                <br /><br />
                Rich: Tell you what I say. Okay.
                <br /><br />
                Jim: Yeah.
                <br /><br />
                Rich: So it's all Ray Charles? (Laughter) I don't think any, all three of them, they know nothing. They don't know it's Ray Charles.
                <br /><br />
                Jim: Yeah. Hey, tell you what I say. Let me tell you about oop-boop-a-doop and that. So that's switching to a whole other song, you know?
                <br /><br />
                Rich: Oop-boop-a-doop. What is that?
                <br /><br />
                Jim: That was a song in the 60s.
                <br /><br />
                Rich: What song? How did that go? (Laughter) What is this song in the 60s that says oop-boop-a-doop?
                <br /><br />
                Jim: No telling.
                <br /><br />
                Rich: All right.
                <br /><br />
                Jim: I'll have to look it up someday and see what it is. Hey, tell you what I say.
                <br /><br />
                Rich: So it's a combination of a couple songs.
                <br /><br />
                Jim: Yeah. And it's playing with their minds all the time. (Laughter) They couldn't sing along.
                <br /><br />
                Rich: Well, they thought they could because they tried and they all sent me lyrics and they were all different.
                <br /><br />
                Jim: Yeah.
                <br /><br />
                Rich: And once I realized they were all different, I said, this is something special.
                <br /><br />
                Jim: Yeah. I started out Ray Charles and then I don't know what I ended up with. I'll have to look up oop-boop-a-doop and see what song that was.

                Jim: The Volkswagen, what's that green sticker? What's that say?
                <br /><br />
                Rich: Oh, the green sticker is the best. It's from 1984. What? Show.
                <br /><br />
                Jim: See, I can't read it because I don't have my glasses. I don't see that green.
                <br /><br />
                Rich: So this is a green. So it's, it's a mix between the European Volkswagen that I found that seemed to match up with the dates that I had access to, and it said, “Sounds like a personal problem to me.” Yeah, this is a 1984 bumper sticker. I'd need to order it off eBay, it's still on there, yeah, because they had a picture of it. And so I just took the picture and photoshopped it onto the Volkswagen.
                <br /><br />
                Jim: So what's it say again?
                <br /><br />
                Rich: It sounds like a personal problem to me.
                <br /><br />
                Jim: Oh, okay, yeah.
                <br /><br />
                Rich: What's the story there?
                <br /><br />
                Jim: I have no idea.
                <br /><br />
                Rich: Have you never said that?
                <br /><br />
                Jim: Oh, yeah, but to whatever they were saying, I would add that, yeah.
                <br /><br />
                Rich: So if I say, "Johanna's being mean to me, yada, yada, I think it's all Cheryl's fault," you would say, "Sounds like a personal problem to me." (Laughter from Jim)
                <br /><br />
                Jim: Don't get me involved.
                <br /><br />
                Rich: Alright, so the Volkswagon, now there's a story there, right? How accurate is that Volkswagon?
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah, we had a '67, which is probably one of the best years they ever made, and we brought, we drove it over there, about 18,000 miles, I think, and then we brought it back here, and it was worth more when I brought it back than we paid for it, you know, it just held its value.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: But you bought it in the US?
                <br /><br />

                Jim: No, we bought it in Germany.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Oh, you bought it in Germany. Okay.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: It was an export model though because I told you, theirs didn't have...
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Left-handed. Was it left-handed steering wheel, or what?
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Well, they, no, they drive on the right side of the road, but it didn't have reinforced bumpers, didn't have shatter-proof windshield, didn't have steel beam headlights, it's just a number of things that they made them put on American.
                Four-point seat belt.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah, seat belts.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Who invented that? There's a famous politician, right? You know what I'm talking about? One of those famous environmentalist politicians. Created the four-point safety belt.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Okay, probably Ralph Nader.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Nader, that's it.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: He's the one who wrote the book about the Corvair, "Unsafe at Any Speed." See, my sister had one, she had a Corvair before I had mine, and she was in, you know, her husband's station in New Mexico, there, Roswell, I guess, and she would drive from there to Pennsylvania non-stop, I mean, she just didn't have enough sense to stop a night and get rest, but there were times she'd be going down the highway, and see, real light vehicle on the front end, no weight there.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Oh, lift up.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Because the motor in the back, you know, and she'd be going down the highway, and she would all of a sudden see herself on the other side of the road, going the other way.
                And that's what they said, "Unsafe at Any Speed." Mine, when you got going up 90 or 100, you weren't sure your front tires were touching the ground. In other words, you better be in a straight line, and don't win.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Or else you gotta flip over.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: So mine I had no problem with, but it was funny, I, you know, I'm driving along in Montgomery and stuff like that, oh, Bill was over at the Army base there in Fort Benning, so he'd come over one weekend, well, he got in, and he took up 100-mile an hour, you know, and I hadn't done that yet, and, but after that, I did. There's a real nice stretch of interstate between Montgomery and Birmingham, it was just straight as an air and safe place, now it's bumper to bumper, you know, because back then it was brand new, and four-liner, and all that good stuff. Well, now it's 50 years old, and can't handle the traffic it got, but back then, see, I'd go up. One time I went with Cheryl up there, grandmothers, the family was going up there. Well, I had a part-time job at night, so I drove back, did my job, and then got up the next morning, and drove back up there, had breakfast with them, you know, and her grandmother got a kick out of how many biscuits I could eat. (Laughter)
                <br /><br />

                Jim: So I could, I guess I put it away then. But in the morning like that, on Sunday morning there's nobody on that highway. So I'm flying away at 100-mile an hour, you know.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Where are folks, they're at church, I guess?
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: That's a Corvair, right?
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Oh, yeah.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: What is she called it, a spider? Is that the model for it?
                <br /><br />

                Jim: This was their number one model. It was a Corvair Spider convertible. I mean, it had four on the floor and it had a turbocharger on it so that it could stay with a Ford V8.
                Up till about 75 or 80 miles an hour before the Ford would pull away. Because that turbocharger was powerful, and yeah, you snap that thing gear and it went like, yeah, you know, nothing like what they make now, but it was their fancy car.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Cheryl says that Corvair may have been what did it for you.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: But it may have been what she said, she liked the idea of the boys eyeing on the choir girls, but...
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: It wasn't until the car showed up that she...
                <br /><br />

                Jim: (Laughter) Yeah.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: For Glenda, she said it was easier. She said Bob asked her to Youth for Christ, I think one night, or Campus Crusade for Christ or something, on a Friday night, and then asked her if he could pick her up for church on a Sunday. But for you, Cheryl says it took a little more effort on account that you had to pull up in that Corvair Spider.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah, it's a nice little convertible, you know, and a neat little car.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: So on that picture, the bumper sticker is "Sounds like a personal problem to me." It's an actual 1984 bumper sticker. It costs $5. I need to just order the damn thing because it's a very real example of that bumper sticker movement. When folks started really getting into silly, kind of funny fonts with bumper stickers and computers and stuff.

            <p>Rich: Okay, so do you remember this story? Because the paint thing, I don't. I made it the colors of PARKAY butter. Those are the yellow and blue that Parquet uses, which I've always associated with that Lions Club breakfast.
                <BR /><BR />

                Rich: Oh, what is that one? Show me the picture. Oh, I put that. It sounded very romantic. So the joke is that somebody gets tongue-tied. And they're saying, "I want to take you over to one of the movies." And you say, "Easy for you to say."
                <br /><br />
                Jim: Yeah.
                <br /><br />

                <br /><br />
                Rich: By kids, if you mean Richard and Carol, I think you're right.
                <br /><br />


                Rich: How did Richard and Carol meet against all odds?
                <br /><br />
                Jim: They, she got out of business college in Minnesota and went to work in Washington, D.C. This is the funny thing. Cheryl and I have her in our scrapbook a year before she meets Richard. We go on our honeymoon. We went to Pennsylvania, and then we stopped in D.C. The other member of the trio that Glenda and Cheryl sang in, dad was... he was down in Montgomery at the Air War College, an officer training thing, you know. And so now he's back in the Pentagon. And so we stop and see them. And so these girls give us a tour of D.C. One of the girls is Cheryl. Yes, one of them, and it's in our scrapbook. She's one of the girls giving us a tour of D.C. And, well, this girl in their trio had a brother that was Richard's age, and so they'd run around together in Montgomery at church, you know. Well, they go back up there. So when he comes through, he's in the Navy and he's at a couple of the bases there, and he stops to see him, you know, and visit with his buddy. Well, so they get introduced. But yeah, she's in a scrapbook a year before she meets Richard. (Laughter)
                <br /><br />
                Rich: Unreal.
                <br /><br />
                Jim: Yeah, really was.
                <br /><br />
                Rich: So she went from Minnesota to D.C. to, where'd they go for that, Houston?
                <br /><br />
                Jim: Mm-hmm. And so she had some good government jobs, you know, G.S. 10s and G.S. 11s and that, you know. She made the big bucks, so got a good retirement. But yeah, she worked for some top doggies there. And then when she got down to Nassau, she was working for the top brass. But yeah, that's it. Minnesota farm girl went to D.C., and Rich found her there. But yeah, we look back at our scrapbook and laugh about that because she's in our scrapbook a year before Richard shows up.

            Rich: Okay, I have a confession about this one. I googled it and I found a song that had similar lyrics, and so the question is, did you know that song, and were you saying it different to the song? What's the story there? And it's the one where...
            <br /><br />
            Jim: Yeah, I don't know the song.
            <br /><br />
            Rich: So this is "I Get Better Looking Every Day," right?
            <br /><br />
            Jim: Oh, yeah.
            <br /><br />
            Rich: And it's that picture of your face on the face of Mac Davis.
            <br /><br />
            Jim: Yeah.
            <br /><br />
            Rich: So that's a Mac Davis photo from that photoshoot he did with Vanity Fair. And it's him saying that funny, that hilarious song. It's like, "I Get Better Looking." So what's the quote?
            <br /><br />
            Jim: "I can't wait until tomorrow. I get better looking every day."
            <br /><br />
            Rich: So where's that come from?
            <br /><br />
            Jim: I picked it up from him or somebody, yeah.
            <br /><br />
            Rich: Okay.
            <br /><br />
            Jim: Yeah, because most likely him because he had it in his song or something. You know?
            <br /><br />
            Rich: Johanna wakes up and says that occasionally, and I agree. She does get better looking each day.
            <br /><br />
            Jim: Yeah, that was one of those you picked up.
            <br /><br />
            Rich: And they said, "And then somebody asked me if that was your hair from a particular time. I said no, that's Mac Davis's hair. But did you ever have hair like that?"
            <br /><br />
            Jim: No.
            <br /><br />
            Rich: Okay, not even as a kid? You didn't have curly hair?
            <br /><br />
            Jim: I did, but it wasn't curly like that.
            <br /><br />
            Rich: Okay.
            <br /><br />
            Jim: I had a big Elvis hairdo, you know, where I combed it straight back. When I combed it forward, it would come down to my chin. You know, it was just swung back.
            <br /><br />
            Rich: Good length.
            <br /><br />
            Jim: Yeah.
            <br /><br />
            Rich: Okay, was it curly? Is that where the girls got it?
            <br /><br />
            Jim: Yeah, they got their curly hair from me. So yeah, it was greased down pretty good. I used to use Vaseline hair tonic, and it was just grease.
            <br /><br />
            Rich: Oh, what was it called? Was it Vaseline?
            <br /><br />
            Jim: Yeah.
            <br /><br />
            Rich: Okay.
            <br /><br />
            Jim: Vaseline hair tonic, and I couldn't buy enough of it, and that just ruined the pillowcases. They were so greasy, you just slid off.
            <br /><br />
            Rich: I did. I tried Brylcreem in the '90s, and Brylcreem was from the '50s.
            <br /><br />
            Jim: Yeah, I used Brylcreem. Okay, so you know.
            <br /><br />
            Rich: I would slick my hair back, '50s style, in the '90s, try to get that Brylcreem look, and the Brylcreem, it was said, their slogan was, “A little dab will do you.” But I did. I had never had any good luck with a little dab. I have.
            <br /><br />
            Jim: No.
            <br /><br />
            Rich: My best luck is with a whole bunch of dab.
            <br /><br />
            Jim: We took a handful and just smeared it back. Yeah, greased our heads. You know what I used when I was out?
            <br /><br />
            Rich: With what?
            <br /><br />
            Jim: If I ran out of Brylcreem or Vaseline?
            <br /><br />
            Rich: What did you use?
            <br /><br />
            Jim: Sugar water.
            <br /><br />
            Rich: Sugar?
            <br /><br />
            Jim: You took sugar water and put it across your head, and then it hardened like that. In other words, it was like a spring.
            <br /><br />
            Rich: Yeah.
            <br /><br />
            Jim: The wind didn't blow it out in your face or nothing. It didn't move.
            <br /><br />
            Rich: So with the Vaseline and the Brylcreem, your hair is not going to be curly, it's going to be slick and straight.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Slick and straight. And then the sugar water was, when I was out of everything else.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Okay.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: And it, you combed it and it just froze right there.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Yeah.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: I don't know where I got that one from, probably from my mother and my sisters. You know?
            <br /><br />

            Rich: So sugar water is referred to as simple syrup. That's something that they, I think, right? That's how they make simple syrup.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Yeah.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: So, yeah, that's Mac Davis. The line for Mac Davis is, “I just can't wait till tomorrow, but I just can't. I can't wait to look in the mirror. I get better looking each day.”
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Okay.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: And Shannon and Joanna and Matt went after me on that one. They said that is incorrect, that's not how Jim said it. And so once again, the Department of Corrections.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Yeah.
            <br /><br />

            Female Speaker (Jo): Hey, it’s a quote book. (Big laughter)
            <br /><br />

            Rich: That is an unauthorized voice on this recording. (Laughter)

                Jim: Yeah. Samson, Delilah. Simpleton and Deluded. That was a pair of cats. That was a nice pair of cats.
                <br /><br />
                Rich: Johanna's favorite.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah, they were, they were special. She, he, uh, they should have, should have had a dozen messigans that day, but they let their bulldogs out, and they caught them. He, he was, would be in the hedges, and he'd run up the tree. Well, that day I'd watered the grass, and he didn't get the traction he needed. And some messigans had let out a backyard full of bulldogs, and they caught him. And, uh, that's when he just needed to shoot more messigans or shoot more dogs. I don't know which, but, uh, because they got that mentality. They all have to have a big dog in their backyard, you know, and, but they can't control.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Okay.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: But that's what got him. And then Delilah, we moved out to the new house. She could never adjust to the new house. She didn't, didn't like anything about it, so I don't know whether she tried to get home or what she did.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Oh, try to go back to 908.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah, because we never saw her again. But, you know, we kept her out there for two or three weeks. Well, one day I let her outside, and we took a walk around the block, and she went with us. And then about halfway around, she disappeared. And I kept looking for her on other people's porches, you know, because a lot of little old ladies in that area, and they had milk and back, backyards full of kittens, you know. And so, but yeah, so she disappeared. But that, that was a nice bunch of cats.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: We bought our cat Cotton.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: After we lost Samson. And that was, that was joining my second anniversary. And the second anniversary is Cotton is the typical gift is the traditional gift. So I arranged with the Siamese folks, I had to fill out all this paperwork about how, like legal paperwork about how we were going to keep it inside and get it to the vet and get the shots and whatnot. But so when she and I showed up, she thought we were spending our anniversary doing a day of volunteering at the Siamese rescue. But what she didn't know is I'd already filled out all the paperwork to where at the end of the day, we got to take home whichever cat she favored. So we did. You're right there.

                Rich: And she was so sweet. And so yeah, Johanna and Amy Sue McGillicuddy and Megamouth and all these folks that you got to nickname.
                <br /><br />
                Jim: Yeah. Yeah. We were in a Dairy Queen, and Megan and her two sons come in, you know. <br /><br />

                Rich: Yeah, it's funny. Like I told you about Megan or Megamouth. I knew her in the 8th grade.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah.
                <br /><br />

            Rich: So I gotta tell you a story. Joanna and Cheryl decided that these were inappropriate for your hood for your hospital room.
            <br /><br />
            Jim: Okay.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Also because I kept calling a hotel room, but they said these are not appropriate, but I thought you might appreciate. Okay, this is the first one. These were signs I bought for your room.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Oh, yeah.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Is that familiar? Is that the one you like?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: That is the John Deere we had, except we had the narrow wheels in the front.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Oh, it went the other way?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Yeah, that's the tractor. Yeah, I've been, I got a model of this tractor.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: I thought so.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: And the red Farmall that we had.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Is that a different brand?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: It's the red one, yeah. It's that what's case international now, but it was the Farmall f-120, and we had it and then traded for the John Deere.

            (Laughter) Yes, that was a funny thing cuz that was the old Patton John. You know when they reason did it on your rotary like on a car or something that the heads are even so that there's a smooth run y'all.

            (Mimicking a sound)
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Like that straight six or is that a different kind of thing?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Yeah, straight six. But your rotary like this, it has the spark plugs and wires coming from it. They're even on a six or an eight on a John Deere. They're like this, you know, and then it has a free ride. (Mimicking a sound) And you know what else makes it gets the same noise but just using a different angle is your old Harley engines. That's what gives their noise.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Okay, 'cause last time we were on Route 66, we ran into some 20s and 30s Harley enthusiasts, and they build their trip on Route 66 around the auto parts stores that they have to stop at.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Yeah.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: And they literally have, you know, here in Oatman, we got to stop at this Auto Zone, and they got a guy in a truck with an ice cooler and some parts with oil and whatnot that's following around, and they go about 45 miles an hour. But yeah, it's the same.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Yeah, we jump in a car or a truck, and we go forever. On a motorcycle, you don't, I mean. (Laughter) The tires don't last a thousand miles because all that wear on them, you know.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: But that's the John Deere. That sounds like it's the same engine, basically.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: It was the, and I don't know how many. I ought to check and see what you, how many years they made it.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Okay, that one in particular.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: They see, ours was a '39.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Oh, that was a, oh, that was his. 1837? I don't know. Okay, I don't know what to.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Yeah, it, so it, I don't know how, where they went into the '40s or '50s before they start adding more cylinders, but.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: That's a three-cylinder, or is your cylinder a six?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: It's a two-cylinder, but you took that engine apart, and that cylinder was bigger than any car or truck.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Wait, so the two-cylinder engine with three spark plugs?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Two. Oh, two spark plugs.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Okay, so putt-putt.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Putt-putt, yeah. They called it the Puttin' John, and it was famous, but my uncle had one on our farm, and he got a kick out pulling the new farm models out of the ditches because they had four cylinders, and some of them six, you know, but if they got stuck, he was pulling them out with a two-cylinder. But it had no power.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: So it was the older, the older ones you pull out?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Yeah.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: So Farmall, what happened to them?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Farmall is Farmall International, which is now Case International. And John Deere still running on their own flag, but then they're huge. But Case and International, and see, they International also had the International trucks, and then they split it off.
  And it's a big organization, you know, because yeah, because we could sell the people the muncher builders and the harvesters and the trucks, you know. All the cotton, because they were used to International, they liked the name.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Right, that's where it's at.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: And they even had the predecessor of the Suburban, you know, the big three-seater car.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Okay. What do you think about that sign? The green one, green and yellow, John Deere green.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Nothing more, nothing more you want, you know. That's the perfect sign.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Do you have one of those, like an actual tractor?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: The actual model tractor, I did.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: A little one?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Yeah.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Do you have a big one?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: No.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: What does a big one go for if it's working? A lot? Thousands of dollars?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Thousands, yeah. They have the FFA at the school north of Lubbock, I guess that would be Cooper South. They rebuild one every once in a while. That team, they'd go to state and win state a lot of times.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: In tractor rebuilding?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Yeah, and if you watch on the farm channel, and they'll see that there's guys have collections of those things.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: What school is that? Abernathy?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Yeah, that's it, Abernathy. Okay. But they put some nice ones together. Get an old frame and go for it, you know.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Yeah. Parts, do the parts match? Everything is matching. Unreal.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: But that is a big business. You flick this station on on Saturday and they--
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Oh, the farm channel.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Yeah, yeah, and they, what they call the old iron show. And they'll open up some of these sheds on these farms. These guys, you know, they work all summer but in the wintertime they basically redo their machines and get them ready. And some of them collect or rebuild a lot of the old guys.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: So they don't use them to farm, they're just--
            <br /><br />

            Jim: They're showing them.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: But they want them to work, right?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Yeah, they want them to show and then no telling what they get for them when they, you know, because you're getting way more than they bought it for new, you know?
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Forty, fifty thousand?  They go on high dollar, and--
            <br /><br />

            Rich: I've seen them at the car auctions.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Yeah. Yeah, they run some through there once in a while.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: So that one you had, what would it go for now in mint condition?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Perfect, it'd be in the thousands. And it depends on how many people want it. You know, they can run them up to 10, 15, 20, and on up, if enough people--if it's a rare one that enough people want.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Do you think John Deere sends out that paint to folks? Like John Deere green paint, color number 075?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Yeah, it's big business.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Oh. Wait, so is there a parts market that John Deere is supporting that they make money off of, you think?
            <br /><br />

            Jim:  Yeah, because there are--they open up these shops and sometimes it's green. There's 50 green tractors in there.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Oh yeah.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: And then another time it's red, it's Case International. And plus all the other colors that used to be around.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Funny that color was everything. Blue, blue and yellow. Who was that?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Yeah, the blue. Ford had blue for a while. See, Ford got into the tractor making business back in the 50s, 40s and 50s. So they made a few thousand. Of course, go through a Ford Museum up in Michigan and they made airplanes.
  (Laughter)
            <br /><br />

            Rich: I've seen the Ford airplane.
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Yeah, I mean they just made anything.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: They said it was heavy, right? Was it heavy? What was the problem with the Ford airplane?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Well, he really needed to stay with cars and that. But he could, he could do anything he wanted to do so they flew and were good planes.
            <br /><br />

            Rich: Yeah, I've seen those military use them, right?
            <br /><br />

            Jim: Yeah.

                Rich: Alright. Here's the next one. We'll let the dog in. You recognize that?
<br /><br />
                Jim: Yeah. You know something? I don't know if I'd ever heard of that beer. (Laughter) Until I was on a deer hunt in Idalou. And that is cool. Thanks. Yeah, we were at a deer hunt in Idaho.
                Bill and I and Matt, and there was this other couple in there helping the couple that run the deer ranch. He was from Pennsylvania. He walked in with a case of that and says, 'Here's what we're drinking tonight,' you know?
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Yeah, how far is that from you?
                <br /><br />

                Jim: From where I live now?
                <br /><br />

                Rich: It's got a town on it listed.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Oh.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Is that where you live now or where you lived then?
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah, Pottsville. Pottsville is the other end of the state. But Pennsylvania had so many German people. That we had a brewery. It was like a gas station. There was a brewery on every corner.
eah, we had Budweiser. Budweiser. We never called it Budweiser. We called it Dubois Budweiser because it was made in Dubois, Pennsylvania, which is 20 miles down the road from me.
All I'd ever heard is Dubois Budweiser. I didn't know they had other plants across the country. But we had Fort Pitt in Pittsburgh. We had Iron City beer in Pittsburgh. We just had all those branches. And then you went to the other end of the state, this end of the state, around Philadelphia. And you had another dozen breweries. So we had breweries everywhere, and some survived and some didn't. But to me, I'd never drank one of those. And so that night after we ate supper when we came in from hunting, we all had a, how do you pronounce it?
Yeungling, okay. Yeah, it, uh, I never heard of it, never drank it. But my brother did, you know.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: It's the oldest brewery in America, right?
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Okay. They recently got a license in Texas, and they're making it in Fort Worth.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Okay.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: But there's rules, they have to make it in Texas to sell it in Texas. So it's funny that the folks are saying, you know, we want this local beer, we want this brewery.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: When all the beer here that you're drinking in a bar or wherever is local, except the stuff that really is imported from Mexico or Japan or Canada. So yeah, Yeungling is made in Fort Worth, but it's from Pennsylvania.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah, and there's some other ones down here from Pennsylvania. Next time I walk by the shelf, I'll have to look at them. But there's a few of them that have made it down here. Iron City, yeah.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Was it called Iron City, the one?
                <br /><br />

                Jim: The beer was called Iron City.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: I've<br /><br />
                never heard of that one.

                Jim: Yeah.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: So they say that when Prohibition hit, was it 20s?
                <br /><br />

                Jim: In the 20s, yeah.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: It had a lot to do with anti-German sentiment. So the question is, you think when Capone and them were smashing up barrels of beer, was it because they were mad at the German folks?
                <br /><br />

                Jim: No, they were. It was the IRS getting them. (Laughter) It was, they were. People had gone crazy. They thought they could control booze, you know. So it was a whole lot of crazy women, really.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: What? Oh, because of the, what do they call that, suffragism?
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah. Yes, mostly a lot of crazy women.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: That's right, actually. Women led that dry movement.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Did you watch that Ken Burns special?
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Some of it, I didn't get to see all of it.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Yeah, he talks a lot about the women's suffrage movement and how they decided to focus a lot of their attention on alcohol.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Without alcohol, men never cheat, they don't lie, they don't steal. Only alcohol causes that, apparently.
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah, it was a crazy world when they thought they could control that. And why didn't the guys let them get away with it, I don't know, but.
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Well, because they wanted, they wanted peace and harmony, right?
                <br /><br />

                Jim: Yeah. (Laughter)
                <br /><br />

                Rich: Okay. Anything else on Yeungling? Before I show you the next sign. I only got three. The ladies told me, they said, these are not appropriate.
